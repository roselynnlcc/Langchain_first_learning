# Langchain_first_learning
 This repository documents my first project with Langchain, inspired by Krish Naik's [Langchain Complete Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O1rs7mrNDo&list=PLZoTAELRMXVORE4VF7WQ_fAl0L1Gljtar&index=1). It showcases my learning and adaptations in applying Langchain's functionalities.

## BlogGeneration
The BlogGeneration project is a Streamlit application leveraging the Langchain library and the Llama 2 model for dynamic blog content creation. Users can input a topic, specify the number of words, and choose an audience style (e.g.  a Fifth Grader / University Student, Working-Class individual, or Retired Person). The application generates a tailored blog post.
