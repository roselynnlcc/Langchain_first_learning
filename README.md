# Langchain_first_learning
 This repository documents my first project with Langchain, inspired by Krish Naik's [Langchain Complete Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O1rs7mrNDo&list=PLZoTAELRMXVORE4VF7WQ_fAl0L1Gljtar&index=1). It showcases my learning and adaptations in applying Langchain's functionalities.

## BlogGeneration
The BlogGeneration project is a Streamlit application leveraging the Langchain library and the Llama 2 model for dynamic blog content creation. Users can input a topic, specify the number of words, and choose an audience style (e.g.  a Fifth Grader / University Student, Working-Class individual, or Retired Person). The application generates a tailored blog post.

## CelebritySearch
Celebrity Search is an interactive web application built with Streamlit and integrated with OpenAI's GPT models. It allows users to search for information about celebrities, including personal profiles and significant events related to their dates of birth.

## Chatbot
This Chatbot project is divided into two main parts: a Streamlit web application and a Jupyter Notebook demonstration. The project utilizes the Langchain OpenAI library to create a responsive and interactive Q&A chatbot.
