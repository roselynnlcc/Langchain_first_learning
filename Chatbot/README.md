# Chatbot Project

## Overview
This Chatbot project is divided into two main parts: a Streamlit web application and a Jupyter Notebook demonstration. The project utilizes the Langchain OpenAI library to create a responsive and interactive Q&A chatbot.

## Project Structure
1. **Streamlit Web Application (`app.py`)**: A user-friendly web application designed to interact with users, providing answers to various queries using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model.
2. **Jupyter Notebook Demonstration (`langchain.ipyb`)**: An educational notebook that demonstrates the usage of Langchain with OpenAI's model, ideal for understanding the underlying mechanics and experimenting with different inputs.

## Deployment
The Streamlit web application is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces. You can interact with the live application here: [Langchain QA Chatbot](https://huggingface.co/spaces/roselynnlcc/Langchain_QA_Chatbot).

## Installation and Setup
To run these projects locally:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the respective directories (`Chatbot/` for the web app, `Notebook/` for the Jupyter notebook).
3. Follow the installation instructions in the README files located in each directory.

## Usage
- **Web Application**: Visit the deployment link to interact with the chatbot directly in your web browser.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Run the notebook cells to see the chatbot's response generation in action and modify as needed for experimentation.
